Task 1: Exploration: Preparing Data for Public Release (34 points)
It's tax season! Imagine that you have been hired as an IT consultant for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), who have assembled what they believe to be the most relevant data from a random sample of 500,000 Americans' tax returns. To support research into the socioeconomics of Americans, they want you to take the data they have sampled from tax returns and prepare it for public release. Of course, there might be some private information in this file, so they want you to pre-process the file in a way that maintains as much utility of the data as possible while minimizing the risks of releasing this data.

You can download the raw CSV file your supervisors have provided here.

Write-up Question 1 (5 points): Describe what you feel are the risks of releasing the data in the original form (i.e., the raw file provided to you above).

Write code (in whatever language you want) to pre-process and prepare this data for public release. You can use whatever strategies you want. Note that this is an exploration task, so you are graded based on your effort, not on your ultimate success in being ethical and responsible. The file you have prepared for public release should be named release.csv.

Write-up Question 2 (5 points): Describe your strategy and approach for creating a data release that maintains as much utility as possible while minimizing the risks described above.
